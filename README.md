This is a minimal viable project demonstrating that it is possbile to unit test a sub-project that relies on dependencies managed by Aspire, such as Postgres, Qdrant, etc.

The project actually does not rely on external dependencies, but it should be possible to pass the connection strings, and use those dependencies in the services defined in the sub-project.
